Genetic Algorithm for the n-Queens Problem

Authors: Moran Gybels, Andreas Radke

Requirements:   Python 3.6+
                Numpy 1.13.3+

We implemented a Genetic Algorithm for solving the n-Queens Problem, n>3


To run the algorithm run in a terminal: 

python main.py

All the configuration is done in the config.py file. 
An exemplary config with reasonable settings is already provided.
